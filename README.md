Rails Engine provides an API of sales data.  Rails Engine loads CSV data into a database and generates various API endpoints to provide data to users.

To use:

```
git clone git@github.com:icorson3/rails_engine.git
cd rails_engine
bundle
rake db:reset
rake db import:all
```

Once you start the server, the following endpoints are available to use.  Additional endpoints as shown in the routes file.
